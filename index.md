Installation
------------

### With composer

Run the following commands:

    php composer.phar create-project lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    cd PATH/TO/YOUR/APP

### With git

Run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition.git PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    cd PATH/TO/YOUR/APP
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

### Then

You can edit `resources/config/prod.php` and start hacking in `src/controllers.php`

### Assets management

Assets are generated for each request in debug mode.
Letting Assetic generate assets dynamically
in a production environment is not optimized.
Instead, each time you deploy your app in the production
environment, you should dump assets using `php console assetic:dump`.
